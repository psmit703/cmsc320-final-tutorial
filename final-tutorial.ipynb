    "Lastly and regarding cleaning the data, there is a decent amount of data that I simply will not need. The primary culprit of this is waste categorization - there are currently three columns for categorizing types of waste. While each has a different level of specificity and a different purpose, the only one that is likely to be needed in this project is the primary category, or the \"Material Group\" column. It is, however, important to keep a copy of the original dataframe just in case that data is needed at some point. So for these purposes, `df` will remain as the original dataframe and `simpleDf` will be the dataframe with only one category. As part of putting it into one category, the values will need to be summed as well. The \"Generator...\" column will necessarily have to be dropped as well, because there is no way to accurate combine different classes in it.\n",

While this may change depending on what a given person's screen size is, it is an important consideration to make.
